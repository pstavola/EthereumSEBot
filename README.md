# Ethereum Stack Exchange Bot!

EthereumSEBot will read Ethereum Stack Exchange platform feed and then it will determine if there's new content since last checked. If there is, then it will publish a post on Twitter for each new content update.

As is, bot will add the following information to a tweet:
* Title of the new content entry
* URL to the new content entry
* Relevant hashtag(s)
* Relevant image

## Required Packages ##

* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Tweepy 3.1.0](http://www.tweepy.org/)
* [feedparser 5.1.3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedparser)

## This is a very old side project. Both EthereumSEBot and twitter profile are no longer active since a long time. ##
